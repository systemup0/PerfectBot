Data and information we require from users:
We need the server, channel and user ID to store the points channel, points count and praise for you.

Users responsibility
Don't give your discord account and password to anyone even someone from our crew, and we don't need it for anything. We only need the user ID.

How can we protect the data of users and servers?
We use a secure external storage site/method, and if something happens, all data stored will be automatically deleted by the bot.

If the user wants their data removed they will need to send an email or contact the developers through Discord include the deletion request file with the type of data they want to delete

By adding our bot you allow us to save temporary data such as server ID and channel ID. If you kick a bot out of your server, the data will be removed automatically via the bot.
